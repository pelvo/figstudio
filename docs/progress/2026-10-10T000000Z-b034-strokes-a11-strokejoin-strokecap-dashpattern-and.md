- 2026-10-10 — Strokes (A11): `strokeJoin`, `strokeCap`, `dashPattern` and per-side border
  weights drawn when no stored geometry applies; stroke overrides drop stale stored outlines.
  Pixel tests in `stroke_style.rs`. The two reported dialogs already matched Figma's border
  weight and radius after the strokeAlign checkpoint; this change does not alter their pixels.
  Not verified: dashed strokes and caps against Figma on a real file.
